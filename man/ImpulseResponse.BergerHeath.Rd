\title{Bioturbation impulse response}
\usage{
ImpulseResponse.BergerHeath(z, d, z0 = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{numeric vector of depths.}

\item{d}{mixing depth in the same units as \code{depth}.}

\item{z0}{depth of the pulse without bioturbation in the same units as
\code{depth}.}
}
\value{
The weights of the bioturbation impulse response function.
}
\description{
Calculate the impulse response function of bioturbation for a given mixing
and pulse depth.
}
\details{
This is an implementation of the solution from Berger and Heath (1968); as
given e.g. on page 65 in Officer and Lynch.
